# Basic-Event-System-for-a-club

This is a basic design me and a friend came up with for a project. Basically, the project involved creating a menu to review the events in a club and their entry, or ticket prices.

We added a function to calculate and keep track of multiple purchases and the total price and will probably improve the code further. A minor error was that the BX register does not
automatically clear when the next part of the program executes.

We managed to fix that with a simple tweak in the Comp function. Essentially we manually cleared it with mov bx, 0.

The entire project is done in assembly and this is just a prototype, anyone who wants to use it is welcome.
